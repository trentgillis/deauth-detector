# Deauthentication Detector

![](assets/github.png)

## How It Works

The deauthentication detector makes use of the scapy python library to detect when a deauthentication attack is occurring. When
an attack is detected, information about the attack is captured and stored in a MongoDB database. This data is then consumed by
a Python Flask web API which serves the deauthentication attack data as JSON to a React web application which displays the
attack information as well as information about the history of previous attacks to the user in an easy to digest format.

## Prerequisites

The following are required to run the deauthentication attack detector

* Python3
* pip3
* Node.js and NPM
* Aircrack-ng
* MongoDB

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to setup the Deauthentication Detector on your current computer

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the deauth-detector directory via the command line
3. Set environmental variable with monitor mode device name
```
export monitorDevice="wlan1mon"
```
4. Run the deploy.sh bash script
```
./deploy.sh
```
4. Once installation concludes, navigate to localhost:3000 via a web browser to view the running dashboard
